## Overview & Purpose
**GHOST-Vault** is an advanced, production-grade cybersecurity tool developed under the **Ghost-SY1** framework. It is designed to perform rigorous security evaluation, automated auditing, or asset intelligence for enterprise environments under strict operational authorizations.

---

## Problem Solved
Security teams and penetration testers frequently deal with fragmented tooling, inconsistent output schemas, and lack of reproducible evidence chains. **GHOST-Vault** standardizes execution flow, clears terminal buffers, presents verified cryptographic telemetry, and enforces non-repudiation.

---

## Architecture & Core Modules
- **Interactive CLI Orchestrator (`main.py`)**: Handles argument parsing, screen cleaning, and official  banner initialization.
- **Engine Layer**: Executes domain-specific logic, risk scoring, or payload verification.
- **Evidentiary Vault**: Stores tamper-evident records authenticated via SHA-256 fingerprinting.

---

## Installation & Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed on your workstation or operational node (Kali Linux / Linux / Windows PowerShell):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhostSy1/GHOST-Vault.git
cd GHOST-Vault
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage Guide & CLI Reference
Run the tool interactively or via command-line flags:

```bash
python3 main.py --help
python3 main.py --target <target_or_file>
```

---

## Input & Output Formats
- **Inputs**: Text files, JSON assessment reports, target lists, or configuration drops.
- **Outputs**: Structured JSON intelligence reports, CSV summaries, and tamper-evident audit ledger entries.

---

## Integration & API Contracts
**GHOST-Vault** integrates natively with **GHOST-Evidence-Fabric** and **GHOST-Vault** through standard JSON/CSV schema validation and SHA-256 chain verification.

---

## Security, Ethics & Authorized Scope
> **Warning**: This tool is strictly intended for authorized security testing, vulnerability research, and educational evaluations within isolated lab environments or with explicit written consent from target asset owners.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Permission Denied**: Run with appropriate execution privileges or verify file access permissions.

## Engineering and release baseline

This repository is maintained as part of the Ghost-SY1 security engineering portfolio. The project is intended for authorized assessment, analysis, or defensive engineering, according to the concrete behavior implemented in the source tree. Results must be derived from operator-supplied inputs and should be reviewed against the documented limitations before they are used in a decision.

### Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Installation, usage, scope, and limitations |
| `docs/` | Detailed operational and architectural documentation |
| `tests/` | Reproducible checks for implemented behavior |
| `.github/workflows/` | Automated quality and release checks |
| `SECURITY.md` | Vulnerability reporting and release hygiene |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution and review requirements |

### Verification

Run the repository-specific command documented above, then run the checks in `.github/workflows/quality.yml` locally where the required runtime is available. Do not interpret a passing syntax check as proof that every deployment or security decision is correct.

### Responsible use

Use only with explicit authorization. Do not commit credentials, private keys, customer data, or raw engagement artifacts. The repository does not provide a guarantee that an observation is a vulnerability; analysts must preserve evidence and validate conclusions independently.
